Hardware preparation:
- VR google
- MPU6050
- Arduino Nano (Master)
- HC-12

- Boat
- Arduino Uno (Slave)
- HC-12

How to use the codes:
1. Upload bluetooth_setup_master.cpp to setup the Arduino Nano
2. Upload bluetooth_setup_slave.cpp to setup the Arduino Uno
3. Upload master.cpp to Master
4. Upload slave.cpp to Slave
